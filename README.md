Glad you got it working! Since the issue was related to an incorrect system time and switching to HTTP temporarily, we can create a simple script to automate these steps after flashing your OpenWrt router. The script will:

Set the correct time using NTP.
Temporarily switch opkg repositories to HTTP.
Run opkg update and install ca-certificates.
Revert repositories back to HTTPS.
Run opkg update again to confirm everything works.
This script assumes your router has internet access and is running OpenWrt (like your 24.10.0 setup on mvebu/cortexa9).

OpenWrt Post-Flash Fix Script
Save the following as fix-opkg.sh:

bash

Copy
#!/bin/sh

# Script to fix opkg update issues after flashing OpenWrt
# 1. Sets correct system time
# 2. Switches opkg to HTTP, updates, installs ca-certificates
# 3. Reverts to HTTPS and verifies

echo "Starting OpenWrt opkg fix..."

# Step 1: Sync system time with NTP
echo "Synchronizing system time..."
ntpd -q -p pool.ntp.org
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Time synchronized successfully."
    date
else
    echo "Failed to sync time. Proceeding anyway..."
fi

# Step 2: Backup opkg feeds configuration
echo "Backing up /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf..."
cp /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf.bak

# Step 3: Switch opkg repositories to HTTP
echo "Switching opkg repositories to HTTP..."
sed -i 's/https:/http:/g' /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf

# Step 4: Run opkg update
echo "Running opkg update with HTTP..."
opkg update
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "opkg update successful."
else
    echo "opkg update failed. Check internet connection or repositories."
    exit 1
fi

# Step 5: Install ca-certificates
echo "Installing ca-certificates..."
opkg install ca-certificates
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "ca-certificates installed successfully."
else
    echo "Failed to install ca-certificates. Check opkg update output."
    exit 1
fi

# Step 6: Restore HTTPS in opkg feeds
echo "Restoring HTTPS in opkg repositories..."
sed -i 's/http:/https:/g' /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf

# Step 7: Verify opkg update with HTTPS
echo "Verifying opkg update with HTTPS..."
opkg update
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "opkg update with HTTPS successful. Setup complete!"
else
    echo "opkg update with HTTPS failed. Check SSL configuration."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Script completed. Your router's opkg should now work correctly."
How to Use the Script
After Flashing OpenWrt:
Log in to your router via SSH (ssh root@192.168.1.1 or your router’s IP).
Create the Script:
Copy the script content above.
Create the file on your router:
text

Copy
vi /root/fix-opkg.sh
Paste the script, save, and exit (:wq).
Make the Script Executable:
text

Copy
chmod +x /root/fix-opkg.sh
Run the Script:
text

Copy
/root/fix-opkg.sh
Check Output:
The script will print progress and any errors.
If it completes successfully, your opkg update should work with HTTPS.
Notes
Storage: The script is small and can be stored in /root/ or another directory. If your router has limited storage, delete it after use:
text

Copy
rm /root/fix-opkg.sh
Backup: The script backs up /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf to distfeeds.conf.bak. If something goes wrong, restore it:
text

Copy
mv /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf.bak /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf
Internet Required: The script assumes your router has internet access. If ping google.com fails, troubleshoot connectivity first.
OpenWrt Version: Tested for OpenWrt 24.10.0, but it should work on similar versions. If repositories change (e.g., in future releases), you may need to update the sed commands.
Security: The script reverts to HTTPS after installing ca-certificates to keep your package downloads secure.
Saving for Next Flash
To avoid recreating the script each time:

Save fix-opkg.sh on your computer or a USB drive.
After flashing, transfer it to the router using scp:
text

Copy
scp fix-opkg.sh root@192.168.1.1:/root/
Alternatively, copy-paste the content into a new file via vi as shown above.
If Issues Arise
If the script fails, check the output for clues (e.g., NTP sync failure, opkg update errors).
Share the error messages, and I can help troubleshoot.
For your Linksys router (mvebu/cortexa9), ensure the firmware matches your device model (e.g., WRT1900ACS, if that’s the one). If you share the model, I can verify compatibility.
This should save you debugging time after future flashes. Let me know if you want to tweak the script or need help running it!
